# About

This project uses n-grams to predict the next move by a human player, on the basis that humans subconciously fit patterns. 
It can also save data between sessions, in order to help build a larger corpus.

Additionally, the `AIPitFight.py` script pits the AI against each itself, to observe if any interesting patterns emerge.
